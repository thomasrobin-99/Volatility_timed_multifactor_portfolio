# Volatility_timed_multifactor_portfolio

The data le for this analysis has monthly returns for nine rm-specic characteristics: Market, SMB, HML, RMW, CMA, UMD, ROE, IA, BAB.  

The first five characteristics (Market, SMB, HML, RMW, CMA) are from Fama and French (2015), the sixth (UMD) is from Carhart (1997), the profitability (ROE) and investment (IA) factors are from Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2015), and the betting-against-beta (BAB) factor is from Frazzini and Pedersen (2014).  

We will construct volatility timed factor portfolio with these 9 factors and compare it's performance against it's unconstrained counterpart. The performance metric for comparison will be Sharpe ratio of the portfolio.
