    "## **1.1 Why one might expect these nine factors to be related to stock returns?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. MKT (market):** The market factor captures the overall compensation investors require for bearing systematic risk. Since most stocks co-move with the market, exposure to aggregate risk drives expected returns. Higher beta stocks tend to earn higher returns as compensation for higher covariance with the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. SMB (size):** Smaller firms are riskier due to less diversified operations, higher distress risk, and lower liquidity, which leads investors to demand higher expected returns. Behavioral explanations (such as limited attention to small stocks) also support a persistent size premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. HML (value):** Value stocks (high book-to-market) often face financial distress or lower growth prospects, increasing their risk and required return. Additionally, investors may overreact to past bad performance, making value stocks undervalued and yielding higher subsequent returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. RMW (profitability):** Firms with robust profitability tend to have more stable cash flows and lower risk, yet markets may underprice these firms due to slow information diffusion. High-profitability firms therefore earn higher risk-adjusted returns as compensation for underlying economic risks or correction of mispricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. CMA (investments):** Firms that invest conservatively are typically more disciplined and face fewer financing frictions, leading to higher expected returns. Conversely, aggressive investment often signals lower future profitability, so low-investment firms outperform high-investment firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. UMD (momentum):** Stocks with strong recent performance tend to continue outperforming in the short to medium term due to underreaction, slow learning, or behavioral biases among investors. Momentum is thus linked to return persistence and delayed price adjustment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. ROE (profitability):** High ROE indicates efficient use of equity capital and strong earnings generation, which predicts higher future cash flows. Markets may underreact to persistent profitability, leading high-ROE firms to earn higher future returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. IA (investments):** Low asset-growth firms tend to outperform because high asset growth is often associated with managerial overinvestment when firm valuations are high. From a risk perspective, firms expanding aggressively are more vulnerable to future cash-flow downturns, justifying lower expected returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. BAB (betting against beta):** High-beta stocks often become overpriced due to leverage constraints that push constrained investors toward higher-beta assets. As a result, low-beta stocks earn higher risk-adjusted returns, making the BAB factor profitable as it exploits this mispricing or risk-based leverage premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference between RMW & ROE:**  \n",
    "RMW = operating profitability–based factor (pre-financing), portfolio return.  \n",
    "Definition: (revenues – cost of goods sold – selling/general/admin expenses – interest expense) divided by book equity.  \n",
    "Fama–French argue that operating profitability is more directly tied to future cashflows, avoiding distortions from leverage and accounting noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROE = accounting profitability (post-financing), firm-level measure used to build a different profitability factor.  \n",
    "Definition: Net Income / Book Equity.  \n",
    "Hou–Xue–Zhang argue ROE is a stronger predictor of expected returns due to its relation to economic theory (investment–profitability dynamics).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference between CMA & IA:**  \n",
    "CMA = asset growth / total investment.  \n",
    "CMA is a portfolio-based factor return from Fama–French that captures return differences between low- and high-investment firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "IA = investment / begining of period total assets  \n",
    "IA is a firm-level accounting ratio measuring investment intensity and used in the q-factor model, not a factor return itself."

    "## **2.3 What do you conclude from your analysis above?**\n",
    "### Expected results:\n",
    "The in-sample sharpe ratios are higher than the corresponding out-of-sample sharpe ratios. This is as espected because all strategies have lower out of sample performance compared to their in-sample counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unexpected results:\n",
    "Unlike Moreira & Muir's results, our volatility timed portfolio has lower sharpe ratio than the original factor portfolio. This could be because:  \n",
    "1) The Moreira–Muir paper uses daily returns, which smooths volatility estimation and reduces noise. Using monthly data produces poor volatility estimates. This leads to noisy volatility-timed factor which in turn results in Sharpe deterioration.\n",
    "2) Volatility managed factors have massive returns which leads to an extreme covariance matrix. $\\Sigma$ becomes ill-conditioned and $\\Sigma^{-1}$ becomes unstable. This leads to noisy weights vector - $\\theta$\n",
    "3) Moreira & Muir did not face the issue because they optimized nothing over multiple factors. They worked with individual factors one at a time, for example: Managed-MKT, Managed-SMB, Managed-HML etc. Our problem is much harder than theirs :)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible solution:\n",
    "The root of our sharpe ratio deterioration occurs due to an ill-conditioned covariance matrix $\\Sigma$. This could perhaps be solved by using shrinking methods on covariance matrix like constant correlation or uncorrelated factors."

    "## **2.4 List the limitations of the strategy of timing factors conditional on their volatilities. Could one implement this volatility-timing policy in practice?**\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "1) This strategy requires extreme and unrealistic leverage. When past volatility is low, 1/$\\sigma^2$ can be very large.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Moreira & Muir conduct in-sample analysis which results in a look ahead bias in their results. Cederburg, O’Doherty, Wang, and Yan (2020) show that the out of sample sharpe ratios are lower than the unmanaged counterpart. This poor out-of-sample performance for volatility-managed portfolios stems primarily from structural instability in the underlying spanning regressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Factors other than the market have very high transaction costs because they take relatively large positions in small-cap stocks that are expensive to trade. This leads to very high transaction costs for managed portfolios. Barroso and Detzel (2021) show that turnover of volatility-managed factors is up to 15 times higher. Accounting for transaction costs demolishes the superior performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Lastly, we already discussed the the limitaion of ill-conditioned covariance matrix when constructiong a portfolio with multiple factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can it be implemented?\n",
    "**YES!** But not in the raw form used in academic studies. In practice, we must impose several constraints such as:  \n",
    "-Leverage cap (e.g., max 3× or 5×)  \n",
    "-Volatility target (e.g., 10% or 12%)  \n",
    "-Smooth scaling over time  \n",
    "-Use 1/σ instead of 1/σ²  \n",
    "\n",
    "Institutional investors often implement volatility targeting, but in a highly constrained, smoothed form — not the raw 1/$\\sigma^2$ scaling. The raw academic volatility-timed factor is NOT tradable without modifications."
